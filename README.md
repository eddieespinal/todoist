# Todoist Go Client
An **EXTREMELY** limited and rough around the edges todoist client in Go. I've been implementing functionality as and when needed for my own personal automation therefore this does not have any tests.

```
t := client.NewClient("<your-API-token-here>")
tasks, _ := t.ListAllTasks()
```

PRs welcome!
